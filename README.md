# FACE-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM-USING-AI AND OPENCV
To build our face recognition system, weâ€™ll first perform face detection, extract face embeddings from each face using deep learning, train a face recognition model on the embeddings, and then finally recognize faces in both images and video streams with OpenCV.

about face recognition 
Face recognition is a method for locating or authenticating the face in digital photographs or video frames. A human can easily and rapidly recognise the faces. For us, it is a simple task, but for a computer, it is challenging. There are many difficulties, including low resolution, occlusion, different lighting conditions, etc. These elements have a significant impact on how accurately the computer can identify faces. The distinction between face detection and face recognition must first be understood.
